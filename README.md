# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

In this project we learned how to use the terminal.

## What we learned

We learned about the different commands such as adding and removing files, editing files and tracking/ untracking files.

Some of the commands to remember are:

<ul>

<li>Git add</li>
<li>Git commit</li>
<li>git status</li>
<li>git push</li>

</ul>

## Thoughts

I think I will have to practice using the terminal alot before it becomes second nature, but I understand it as of now.
